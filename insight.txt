It's my first ML project on classification problem

-  classification is a supervised ML problem

-  First I've cleaned the data to get the necessary columns for model (such as species,island,region,sex etc)

-  Then I've plotted 2 bar graphs specifying species and islands to get some graphical information on data

-  heatmap on correlation of data gives us the clear information on data

-  To classify more than 2 objects im using Random Forest classification algorithm from sklearn
