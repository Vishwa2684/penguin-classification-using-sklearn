# sklearn model to classify penguins based on flipper length,culmen length,culmen depth,body mass ,gender and island
- i did this project to understand how to link frontend with our ML model
- I'm interested in doing further projects related to AI/ML
- I used sklearn to create the ML model
- If u guys have better ways to filter and clean the data or improve something in the model just drop them in issues
